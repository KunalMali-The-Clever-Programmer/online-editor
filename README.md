Description:
The Online Code Editor for GitHub is a web-based tool that allows users to write, edit, and execute HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly within their web browser.

Key Features:

Code Editing: Users can write and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate editor panes with syntax highlighting for better readability.

Customizable Themes: Users can choose from a selection of pre-defined themes or customize the editor's appearance to suit their preferences.

Autosave: The editor automatically saves changes locally, preventing data loss in case of accidental browser closure or refresh.
